# 🎮 Letter Quest:Hangman Adventure!

A fun and interactive GUI-based Hangman game built using Python and Tkinter, designed with a modern glassmorphism-inspired interface. Players guess a randomly chosen English word, 
and if they fail — they’ll not only see the word but also learn its **meaning**, **example**, **synonyms**, and **antonyms**. Educational *and* fun!
